<h1>About New Path</h1>

<p> New Path is an app that lets a user record their meals in order to keep track of their current diet.  It gives a user the ability to record data by adding a meal title, a description of their meal, and the amount of calories they consumed during that meal.  Each user has their own individual profile where they have the ability to create, edit, or destroy their own individual meals.</p>

<h1> Technologies Used </h1>
<ul>
	<li> Ruby </li>
	<li> Rails Framework </li>
	<li> SQL </li>
	<li> Boostrap </li>
	<li> Millagram </li>
	<li> HTML & CSS </li>
</ul>


<h1> Approach Taken </h1>
<p> Started with the trello board and ERD model to get a good blueprint of creating my user models.  I began by designing my "User" model and then deciding to take it a step furthure by designing my "Meals" model. After that when I started creating the actual app I created a functional login form for new users and current users, therefore; creating a Restful root.  After that I generated the meals model along with making sure that I implemented CRUD into the application. Allowing a user the ability to create, edit, or destory their meals.  Lastly, made sure that it would allow the user to logout properly; therefore, making sure that their personal portal would be secure. </p>
 
<h1> Installation/startup instructions </h1>
How can a potential employer run your code locally on their own machine?
<ul>
	<li> Make sure Bootstrap is installed in their gemfile </li>
	<li> Must also have Ruby on Rails 4+ to run </li>
	<li> Ensure that sprockets-rails is at least version 2.3.2.</li>
	<li> Also have Autoprefixer documentation which adds vender prefixes</li>
</ul>

<h1> Unsolved Problems and Next Steps </h1>
<p> Although; I figured out how to allow a user to create, edit, and destroy a meal.  I was not able to finish getting the user to delete or edit their infromation, which would be the next steps to upgrading the app into a nicer layout for it's users. </p>
